# CCNA Containers - Concise Guide

## Virtual Machines Review

### VM Basics
- **Virtual Machines (VMs)**: Multiple operating systems on one physical server
- **Hypervisor**: Software that manages VMs and allocates hardware resources
- Each VM runs complete OS with **Bins/Libs** (software libraries/services)

### Hypervisor Types
**Type 1 (Bare-metal)**:
- Runs directly on hardware
- Used in data centers
- Examples: VMware ESXi, Microsoft Hyper-V

**Type 2 (Hosted)**:
- Runs on host operating system
- Used on personal devices
- Examples: VMware Workstation, VirtualBox, Cisco Modeling Labs (CML)

### VM Characteristics
- Strong isolation (each VM has own OS)
- Easy to create, delete, migrate between servers
- Can run different OS types simultaneously

## Containers

### Container Basics
- **Containers**: Software packages with app + all dependencies (Bins/Libs)
- Run on **Container Engine** (example: Docker Engine)
- Container Engine runs on host OS (usually Linux)
- Lightweight and portable

### Container Features
- **One app per container** (best practice)
- Include only required dependencies
- Boot in **milliseconds**
- **Small size** (megabytes)

### Container Orchestration
- **Container Orchestrator**: Automates deployment, management, scaling
- **Kubernetes**: Most popular (originally by Google)
- **Docker Swarm**: Docker's orchestration tool
- Needed for large-scale systems with thousands of containers

## VM vs Container Comparison

| Feature | Virtual Machines | Containers |
|---------|------------------|------------|
| **Boot Time** | Minutes | Milliseconds |
| **Size** | Gigabytes | Megabytes |
| **Resource Usage** | High (full OS per VM) | Low (shared OS) |
| **Isolation** | Strong (own OS) | Moderate (shared OS) |
| **Portability** | Good | Excellent |
| **Failure Impact** | Isolated | Shared OS risk |

## Key Technologies

### Container Technologies
- **Docker Engine**: Most popular container engine
- **Kubernetes**: Leading orchestration platform
- **Docker Hub**: Public container image registry
- **Microservices**: Architecture pattern using containers

### When to Use Each

**Use VMs for**:
- Different operating systems needed
- Strong isolation requirements
- Legacy applications
- Long-running enterprise services

**Use Containers for**:
- Microservices architecture
- Cloud-native applications
- Rapid deployment needs
- Maximum resource efficiency
- DevOps/CI/CD pipelines

## CCNA Exam Focus

### Key Points
1. **Architecture Differences**: VM (full OS) vs Container (shared OS)
2. **Performance**: Containers faster to start, use fewer resources
3. **Isolation**: VMs stronger isolation, containers more efficient
4. **Use Cases**: When to choose each technology
5. **Technologies**: Docker, Kubernetes, container orchestration

### Common Questions
- Compare VM and container characteristics
- Identify when to use VMs vs containers
- Recognize major container platforms
- Understand orchestration benefits
