## Introduction to Virtualization

### What is Virtualization?
Virtualization is a technology that allows multiple operating systems to run on a single physical server by abstracting hardware resources and creating virtual instances called Virtual Machines (VMs).

### Pre-Virtualization Era
- **One-to-One Relationship**: Each physical server ran a single operating system
- **Dedicated Services**: Separate physical servers for web services, email, databases, etc.
- **Inefficiencies**:
  - High hardware costs and space requirements
  - Underutilized resources (CPU, RAM, storage)
  - Increased power consumption and cooling needs

### Key Benefits of Virtualization
- **Resource Optimization**: Better utilization of hardware resources
- **Cost Reduction**: Fewer physical servers required
- **Flexibility**: Easy deployment and management of services
- **Scalability**: Quick provisioning of new virtual machines

## Virtual Servers

### Major Server Vendors
- **Dell**: PowerEdge series
- **EMC**: VxRail, PowerEdge
- **HPE** (Hewlett Packard Enterprise): ProLiant series
- **IBM**: Power Systems, System x
- **Cisco**: UCS (Unified Computing System)

### Cisco UCS Overview
Although Cisco is primarily known for networking devices (routers, switches, firewalls), they also manufacture enterprise-grade servers through their Unified Computing System (UCS) line.

## Hypervisor Technologies

### What is a Hypervisor?
A hypervisor, also known as a Virtual Machine Monitor (VMM), is software that manages and allocates hardware resources to virtual machines.

### Type 1 Hypervisors (Bare-Metal/Native)

#### Characteristics:
- Runs directly on physical hardware
- No underlying operating system required
- Primary choice for data center environments
- Superior performance and security

#### Popular Type 1 Hypervisors:
- **VMware ESXi**: Industry-leading enterprise hypervisor
- **Microsoft Hyper-V**: Integrated with Windows Server
- **Citrix XenServer**: Enterprise virtualization platform
- **Red Hat KVM**: Open-source Linux-based hypervisor

#### Architecture:
```
┌─────────────────────────────────────┐
│     VM1    │    VM2    │    VM3     │
├─────────────────────────────────────┤
│          Type 1 Hypervisor         │
├─────────────────────────────────────┤
│        Physical Hardware           │
└─────────────────────────────────────┘
```

### Type 2 Hypervisors (Hosted)

├─────────────────────────────────────┤
│        Physical Hardware           │
└─────────────────────────────────────┘
```

### Key Virtualization Concepts

#### Partitioning
- Multiple operating systems on one physical machine
- Dynamic resource allocation between VMs
- Isolated execution environments

#### Isolation
- Fault isolation: Issues in one VM don't affect others
- Security isolation: Separate security boundaries
- Performance isolation: Resource controls prevent VM interference

#### Encapsulation
- VM state saved to files
- Easy backup and restore operations
- VM portability across different hosts

#### Hardware Independence
- VMs can migrate between different physical servers
- Abstraction from underlying hardware specifics
- Simplified disaster recovery and load balancing

#### Network Architecture:
```
┌──────────┐    ┌──────────┐    ┌──────────┐
│   VM1    │    │   VM2    │    │   VM3    │
│  VLAN 10 │    │  VLAN 20 │    │  VLAN 10 │
└────┬─────┘    └────┬─────┘    └────┬─────┘
     │               │               │
┌────┴───────────────┴───────────────┴─────┐
│           Virtual Switch                 │
└────────────────┬─────────────────────────┘
                 │
           ┌─────┴─────┐
           │ Physical  │
           │    NIC    │
           └───────────┘
```
