## Introduction to Wireless Network Security {#introduction}

### Why Wireless Security is Critical
- **Open Medium**: Wireless signals broadcast through the air and can be intercepted by any device within range
- **No Physical Boundaries**: Unlike wired networks where physical access is required
- **Increased Attack Surface**: More vulnerable to eavesdropping, man-in-the-middle attacks, and unauthorized access
- **Corporate Requirements**: Need to protect sensitive data and limit access to authorized users only

### Key Differences from Wired Security
- **Wired Networks**: Traffic typically encrypted only when crossing untrusted networks (like the Internet)
- **Wireless Networks**: ALL traffic between clients and access points should be encrypted

---

## Core Security Concepts {#core-concepts}

### 1. Authentication
**Purpose**: Verify the identity of users/devices before granting network access

**Requirements**:
- All clients must authenticate before associating with an AP
- Corporate environments should implement strong authentication
- Guest networks should be isolated from corporate resources
- Mutual authentication (client ↔ AP) prevents rogue AP attacks

**Methods**:
- Password-based
- Username/Password combinations
- Digital certificates
- Multi-factor authentication

### 2. Encryption
**Purpose**: Protect data confidentiality during transmission

**Key Points**:
- Traffic between clients and APs must be encrypted
- Each client uses unique encryption/decryption keys
- Prevents unauthorized users from reading intercepted data
- Group keys used for broadcast/multicast traffic

### 3. Integrity
**Purpose**: Ensure messages aren't modified during transmission

**Implementation**:
- Message Integrity Check (MIC) added to frames
- Detects tampering or corruption
- Ensures data received matches data sent
- Protects against man-in-the-middle attacks

## Authentication Methods {#authentication-methods}

### Open Authentication
```
Client → Authentication Request → AP
Client ← Authentication Accept ← AP
```
- **Security Level**: None
- **Usage**: Public hotspots, guest networks
- **Process**: AP accepts any authentication request
- **Additional Security**: Often combined with captive portals or other authentication methods

### WEP (Wired Equivalent Privacy)
**⚠️ DEPRECATED - DO NOT USE**

**Characteristics**:
- Uses RC4 encryption algorithm
- Shared-key protocol (same key on sender/receiver)
- Key lengths: 40-bit or 104-bit + 24-bit IV = 64-bit or 128-bit total
- Easily cracked - can be broken in minutes

**WEP Authentication Process**:
1. Client requests authentication
2. AP sends challenge text
3. Client encrypts challenge with shared key
4. AP decrypts and verifies response

---

## EAP (Extensible Authentication Protocol) {#eap}

### EAP Framework
- **Purpose**: Standardized authentication framework
- **Flexibility**: Supports multiple authentication methods
- **Integration**: Works with 802.1X for network access control

### EAP Methods for CCNA

#### 1. LEAP (Lightweight EAP)
**⚠️ DEPRECATED - Cisco proprietary**
- **Authentication**: Username/password
- **Security**: Mutual authentication with challenge phrases
- **Keys**: Dynamic WEP keys (frequently changed)
- **Vulnerability**: Considered insecure, no longer recommended

#### 2. EAP-FAST (EAP Flexible Authentication via Secure Tunneling)
**Cisco proprietary - Three phases**:

**Phase 1**: PAC (Protected Access Credential) provisioning
```
Server → PAC → Client
```

**Phase 2**: TLS tunnel establishment
```
Client ↔ Secure TLS Tunnel ↔ Authentication Server
```

**Phase 3**: Client authentication within tunnel
```
Encrypted authentication exchange inside TLS tunnel
```

#### 3. PEAP (Protected EAP)
**Industry standard - Two phases**:

**Phase 1**: TLS tunnel establishment
- Server has digital certificate
- Client authenticates server using certificate
- TLS tunnel established

**Phase 2**: Client authentication
- Client authenticated within secure tunnel
- Common inner method: MS-CHAP (Microsoft Challenge-Handshake Authentication Protocol)

```
Client ↔ [TLS Tunnel with Server Certificate] ↔ Server
       └─ Inner Authentication (MS-CHAP) ─┘
```

#### 4. EAP-TLS (EAP Transport Layer Security)
**Most Secure Method**:
- **Certificates**: Required on both server AND every client
- **Mutual Authentication**: Both parties authenticate with certificates
- **No Inner Authentication**: Certificate-based authentication sufficient
- **Implementation**: More complex due to certificate management
- **Security**: Highest level of wireless security

```
Client Certificate ↔ [Mutual TLS Authentication] ↔ Server Certificate
```

## 802.1X Framework {#8021x}

### Purpose
Port-based network access control that limits network access until authentication is completed.

### Three Main Entities

#### 1. Supplicant
- **Role**: Device requesting network access
- **Examples**: Laptop, smartphone, tablet
- **Function**: Initiates authentication process

#### 2. Authenticator
- **Role**: Network access device (Access Point in wireless)
- **Function**: 
  - Receives authentication requests
  - Forwards credentials to authentication server
  - Enforces access control decisions
  - Acts as intermediary between client and server

#### 3. Authentication Server (AS)
- **Role**: Validates credentials and makes access decisions
- **Common Implementation**: RADIUS server
- **Function**:
  - Receives forwarded credentials
  - Validates against user database (Active Directory, LDAP, local)
  - Returns ACCEPT/REJECT decision
  - May provide authorization attributes

### 802.1X Process Flow
```
1. Supplicant → Authentication Request → Authenticator
2. Authenticator → Forwards Request → Authentication Server
3. Authentication Server → Access Decision → Authenticator
4. Authenticator → Grants/Denies Access → Supplicant
```

## Encryption & Integrity Methods {#encryption-integrity}

### TKIP (Temporal Key Integrity Protocol)
**Transitional Solution - Used in WPA**

**Purpose**: Improve WEP security while maintaining hardware compatibility

**Security Features**:
- **MIC (Message Integrity Check)**: Protects message integrity
- **Key Mixing Algorithm**: Unique WEP key per frame
- **Extended IV**: 48-bit initialization vector (vs. 24-bit in WEP)
- **Sender MAC Address**: Included in MIC for sender identification
- **Timestamp**: Prevents replay attacks
- **TKIP Sequence Number**: Tracks frames from each source MAC

**Limitations**:
- Still based on vulnerable WEP
- Considered legacy - not recommended for new deployments

### CCMP (Counter/CBC-MAC Protocol)
**Modern Standard - Used in WPA2**

**Requirements**: Hardware support needed (not backward compatible with WEP-only hardware)

**Two-Algorithm Approach**:

#### 1. AES Counter Mode Encryption
- **Algorithm**: Advanced Encryption Standard (AES)
- **Mode**: Counter mode for encryption
- **Security**: Currently the strongest encryption standard
- **Global Usage**: Widely adopted worldwide

#### 2. CBC-MAC (Cipher Block Chaining Message Authentication Code)
- **Purpose**: Provides Message Integrity Check (MIC)
- **Function**: Ensures data hasn't been tampered with

### GCMP (Galois/Counter Mode Protocol)
**Latest Standard - Used in WPA3**

**Advantages**:
- More secure than CCMP
- Higher efficiency = better throughput
- Optimized for modern hardware

**Two-Algorithm Approach**:

#### 1. AES Counter Mode Encryption
- Same strong AES encryption as CCMP
- Optimized implementation

#### 2. GMAC (Galois Message Authentication Code)
- **Purpose**: Message Integrity Check
- **Advantage**: More efficient than CBC-MAC

## Wi-Fi Protected Access (WPA) {#wpa}

### WPA Certification Overview
**Wi-Fi Alliance Standards**: Equipment must pass authorized testing labs

### Authentication Modes (All WPA Versions)

#### Personal Mode (PSK - Pre-Shared Key)
**Use Cases**: Home networks, small businesses

**Characteristics**:
- Single password shared among all users
- Pre-Shared Key (PSK) used for authentication
- PSK not transmitted over the air
- Four-way handshake generates unique session keys

**Four-Way Handshake Process**:
```
1. AP → ANonce → Client
2. Client → SNonce + MIC → AP
3. AP → GTK + MIC → Client  
4. Client → ACK → AP
```

#### Enterprise Mode (802.1X)
**Use Cases**: Corporate environments, large organizations

**Characteristics**:
- Individual user credentials
- RADIUS authentication server required
- Supports all EAP methods (PEAP, EAP-TLS, etc.)
- Centralized user management
- Better audit trails and user tracking

### WPA Evolution
