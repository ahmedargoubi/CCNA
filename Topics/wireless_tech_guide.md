**Speed:** 10-100 Mbps

**Use Cases:**
- Last-mile broadband access
- Rural internet connectivity
- Backup for wired connections
- Mobile internet in vehicles

**Pros:**
- Long range coverage
- Alternative to cable/DSL
- Can cover entire city

**Cons:**
- Limited adoption
- Expensive infrastructure
- Mostly replaced by LTE/5G

**Think of it as:** Wireless DSL/Cable replacement for neighborhoods

---

### 3. Cellular Broadband (4G/5G)

**Purpose:** Wide area mobile internet access

**Range:** 1-10 km per tower (varies)

**Speed:**
- 4G LTE: 5-100 Mbps
- 5G: 100 Mbps - 10 Gbps

**Use Cases:**
- Smartphone internet
- Mobile hotspots
- IoT device connectivity
- Vehicle internet
- Rural broadband (fixed wireless)

**Pros:**
- Wide coverage
- Mobile (works while moving)
- High speeds (especially 5G)
- Widely available

**Cons:**
- Data caps/expensive
- Speed varies by location
- Requires cell tower proximity

**Think of it as:** Internet anywhere you have cell signal

---

### 4. Satellite Broadband

**Purpose:** Remote area internet access

**Range:** Global (satellite orbit)

**Speed:**
- Traditional: 12-100 Mbps
- Starlink: 50-200 Mbps

**Use Cases:**
- Rural/remote locations
- Maritime (ships)
- Aviation (planes)
- Disaster recovery
- Areas without infrastructure

**Pros:**
- Works anywhere on Earth
- No ground infrastructure needed
- Good for remote areas

**Cons:**
- High latency (500-700ms traditional)
- Expensive equipment
- Weather interference
- Data caps

**Think of it as:** Internet from space when nothing else works

## Most Important Wireless Organizations

### 1. IEEE (Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers)

**What they do:** Develop wireless standards

**Key Standards:**
- **802.11 (Wi-Fi)** - Wireless LAN standards
  - 802.11a, 802.11b, 802.11g
  - 802.11n (Wi-Fi 4)
  - 802.11ac (Wi-Fi 5)
  - 802.11ax (Wi-Fi 6/6E)
- **802.15** - Bluetooth/PAN standards
- **802.16** - WiMAX standards

**Why important:** Sets technical standards that manufacturers follow

**Example:** When you see "802.11ac" on a router, that's an IEEE standard

---

### 2. Wi-Fi Alliance

**What they do:** Certify Wi-Fi products and promote Wi-Fi adoption

**Key Programs:**
- **Wi-Fi CERTIFIEDâ„¢** - Product testing and certification
- **Wi-Fi 6** branding (easier than saying 802.11ax)
- **WPA3** - Security standard
- **Wi-Fi Direct** - Device-to-device connections
- **Wi-Fi Protected Setup (WPS)**

**Why important:** Ensures different manufacturers' products work together

**Example:** "Wi-Fi CERTIFIED" logo means the device passed compatibility tests

---

### 3. ITU (International Telecommunication Union)

**What they do:** UN agency for global telecom standards

**Key Responsibilities:**
- **Radio spectrum allocation** - Who uses which frequencies globally
- **3G/4G/5G** standards (IMT-2000, IMT-Advanced, IMT-2020)
- **Satellite orbital positions**
- **International telecom regulations**

**Why important:** Coordinates global wireless communications to prevent interference

**Example:** Ensures your phone works when traveling internationally

## Organization Comparison

| Organization | Focus | Key Contribution |
|--------------|-------|------------------|
| **IEEE** | Technical standards | 802.11 Wi-Fi standards, 802.15 Bluetooth |
| **Wi-Fi Alliance** | Product certification | Wi-Fi CERTIFIED, WPA3, branding (Wi-Fi 6) |
| **ITU** | Global coordination | Spectrum allocation, 3G/4G/5G standards |

---

## How They Work Together

**Example: Wi-Fi 6 Device**

1. **IEEE** creates technical standard (802.11ax)
2. **Wi-Fi Alliance** tests products and brands as "Wi-Fi 6"
3. **ITU** ensures it doesn't interfere with other technologies globally

**Example: 5G Phone**

1. **ITU** defines 5G requirements (IMT-2020)
2. **3GPP** (related org) creates technical specs
3. **IEEE** may contribute specific technologies
4. Device manufacturers build to these standards
