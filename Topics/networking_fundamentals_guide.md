## OSI and TCP/IP Models {#models}

### OSI Reference Model

The **Open Systems Interconnection (OSI)** model is a conceptual framework with 7 layers:

| **6** | **Presentation** | Data formatting, encryption | SSL/TLS, JPEG, GIF |
| **5** | **Session** | Managing sessions between applications | SQL sessions, RPC |
| **4** | **Transport** | End-to-end data delivery | TCP, UDP |
| **3** | **Network** | Routing and logical addressing | IP, OSPF, BGP |
| **2** | **Data Link** | Frame formatting and error detection | Ethernet, Wi-Fi, PPP |
| **1** | **Physical** | Physical transmission of data | Cables, hubs, repeaters |

### TCP/IP Model

The **TCP/IP model** is a practical 4-layer model used in real networks:

| **Transport** | Layer 4 | End-to-end communication | TCP, UDP |
| **Internet** | Layer 3 | Routing and addressing | IP, ICMP, ARP |
| **Network Access** | Layers 1-2 | Physical network access | Ethernet, Wi-Fi |

### Data Encapsulation Process

As data moves down the protocol stack, each layer adds its own header:

```
Application Data
↓
[TCP Header][Application Data] ← Transport Layer
↓
[IP Header][TCP Header][Application Data] ← Network Layer
↓
[Ethernet Header][IP Header][TCP Header][Application Data][Ethernet Trailer] ← Data Link Layer
```
