## Answer Key

**Question 1: B) Switch**  
*Explanation: Switches are designed to connect multiple devices within the same LAN, operating at Layer 2 and using MAC addresses for forwarding decisions.*

**Question 2: C) Layer 3 (Network)**  
*Explanation: Routers operate at Layer 3 of the OSI model and make forwarding decisions based on IP addresses.*

**Question 3: B) MAC addresses**  
*Explanation: Switches operate at Layer 2 and use MAC addresses to forward frames to the correct destination.*

**Question 4: C) They offer application awareness and intrusion prevention**  
*Explanation: NGFWs provide advanced features including application awareness, intrusion prevention, and deep packet inspection.*

**Question 5: C) Act as both clients and servers depending on the situation**  
*Explanation: In P2P networks, devices can function as both clients and servers based on the specific interaction.*

**Question 6: C) Router**  
*Explanation: Routers connect different networks, including connecting internal LANs to the Internet via ISPs.*

**Question 7: B) Host-based firewall**  
*Explanation: Host-based firewalls are installed on individual devices to protect only that specific device.*

**Question 8: C) Convert digital signals to analog signals for transmission**  
*Explanation: Modems convert digital signals from routers into analog signals for transmission over mediums like DSL, cable, or fiber.*

**Question 9: B) Switches**  
*Explanation: Switches support VLANs for segmenting broadcast domains within the same physical network.*

**Question 10: C) Perform routing between different networks**  
*Explanation: Layer 3 switches can perform routing functions in addition to standard Layer 2 switching, allowing them to route packets between different networks.*
