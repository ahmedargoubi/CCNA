B) Terabytes due to dependencies  
C) Megabytes, much less than VMs  
D) The same amount as physical servers

---

### Question 10

A) Containers continue running independently  
B) Only some containers are affected  
C) All containers on that host are affected  
D) Containers automatically migrate to other hosts

## Answer Key

| Question | Answer | Explanation |
|----------|--------|-------------|
| 1 | **A** | Type 1 (bare-metal) hypervisors are used in data centers |
| 2 | **C** | Containers boot in milliseconds, VMs take minutes |
| 3 | **C** | Hypervisor manages and allocates resources to VMs |
| 4 | **C** | Containers meet all requirements: fast, lightweight, portable |
| 5 | **B, D** | VMware Workstation and VirtualBox are Type 2 hypervisors |
| 6 | **B** | Containers share host OS, VMs run individual operating systems |
| 7 | **C** | Kubernetes was originally designed by Google |
| 8 | **B** | VMs with Type 1 hypervisor provide strong isolation and multi-OS |
| 9 | **C** | Containers use megabytes vs gigabytes for VMs |
| 10 | **C** | All containers affected since they share the host OS |
