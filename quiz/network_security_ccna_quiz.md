## ANSWER KEY & EXPLANATIONS

**Question 1: A, B, C** - Viruses, Worms, Trojan horses  
*Explanation: These are the three main types of malware. Viruses attach to programs, worms self-replicate across networks, and Trojans appear legitimate but contain malicious code.*

**Question 2: B** - Information theft, data loss, identity theft, disruption of service  
*Explanation: These are the four primary network threat types that organizations face according to CCNA curriculum.*

**Question 3: B** - `auto secure`  
*Explanation: The AutoSecure feature automatically configures security settings and disables unnecessary services on Cisco devices.*

**Question 4: C** - DoS comes from a single source, DDoS comes from multiple sources  
*Explanation: DoS (Denial of Service) attacks originate from one source, while DDoS (Distributed DoS) attacks use multiple coordinated sources.*

**Question 5: B** - Defense-in-depth  
*Explanation: Defense-in-depth is a security strategy that employs multiple layers of security controls to protect against threats.*

**Question 6: B** - To provide a secure area for hosting public-facing servers  
*Explanation: A DMZ is a network segment that separates internal networks from external ones, providing a controlled environment for public services.*

**Question 7: B** - `service password-encryption`  
*Explanation: This global configuration command encrypts passwords stored in the running and startup configurations.*

**Question 8: C** - Technological, configuration, security policy  
*Explanation: These are the three primary vulnerability categories: technology weaknesses, configuration errors, and policy gaps.*

**Question 9: C** - Man-in-the-middle attack  
*Explanation: MITM attacks involve intercepting and potentially altering communications between two parties without their knowledge.*

**Question 10: B** - Authentication, Authorization, Accounting  
*Explanation: AAA framework provides identity verification (Authentication), permission control (Authorization), and activity logging (Accounting).*

**Question 11: B** - Worm  
*Explanation: Worms are self-replicating malware that can spread across networks independently without needing a host program.*

**Question 12: B** - Sets minimum password length to 10 characters  
*Explanation: This command enforces a minimum password length requirement of 10 characters for enhanced security.*

**Question 13: A, C, D** - Ping sweeps, Port scans, Internet queries  
*Explanation: These are reconnaissance techniques used to gather information about target networks before launching attacks.*

**Question 14: B** - To reduce the attack surface  
*Explanation: Disabling unnecessary services reduces potential entry points for attackers, minimizing the attack surface.*

**Question 15: C** - VPN (Virtual Private Network)  
*Explanation: VPNs create encrypted tunnels over public networks to provide secure remote access to private networks.*
