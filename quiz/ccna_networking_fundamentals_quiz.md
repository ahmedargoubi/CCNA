## ANSWER KEY

**Question 1: B, D** - They are the interface between humans and the communication network / They originate the data that flows through the network  
*End devices serve as the interface for users to access the network and are the source/destination of network communications.*

**Question 2: B** - Hub-and-spoke  
*For small networks where employees rarely communicate directly with each other, hub-and-spoke provides the most cost-effective solution with centralized resources.*

**Question 3: C** - DSL  
*DSL (Digital Subscriber Line) uses existing telephone lines and can carry both voice and data simultaneously through frequency division.*

**Question 4: A, C** - Easily supports new users and applications / Grows in size without impacting the performance of services to existing users  
*Scalable networks can expand to accommodate growth without degrading performance for existing users.*

**Question 5: B** - LAN  
*A Local Area Network (LAN) spans a small geographical area like a building or campus and is typically owned by a single organization.*

**Question 6: B** - Client-server networks use centralized resources, while peer-to-peer networks share resources among all devices  
*The fundamental difference is resource management: centralized vs distributed.*

**Question 7: C** - Antivirus software and basic firewall filtering  
*Small home offices typically use basic security measures rather than enterprise-grade solutions.*

**Question 8: B, D** - Viruses and worms / Zero-day attacks  
*These are external security threats that target networks from outside the organization.*

**Question 9: C** - SaaS (Software as a Service)  
*SaaS provides complete applications accessible through web browsers (like Gmail, Office 365).*

**Question 10: C** - Fault tolerance  
*Fault tolerance is the network's ability to continue operating when components fail, providing redundancy and alternate paths.*

**Question 11: C** - Switch  
*Switches are intermediary devices that connect end devices and forward data between them.*

**Question 12: C** - To prioritize traffic and manage congestion  
*QoS manages network traffic to ensure important applications receive adequate bandwidth and performance.*

**Question 13: B** - BYOD (Bring Your Own Device)  
*BYOD policies allow employees to use personal smartphones, tablets, and laptops for work purposes.*

**Question 14: C** - MAN  
*A Metropolitan Area Network (MAN) typically covers a city or metropolitan area, connecting multiple buildings.*

**Question 15: B, D** - Network media provides the channel over which messages travel from source to destination / Network media varies in cost depending on the environment where it is installed  
*Network media serves as the transmission channel, and costs vary based on environmental requirements (indoor vs outdoor, distance, etc.).*

## Study Tips for CCNA Networking Fundamentals

### High-Frequency Topics:
1. **Device Types**: End devices vs intermediary devices and their functions
2. **Network Types**: LAN, WAN, PAN, MAN characteristics and appropriate use
3. **Network Characteristics**: Fault tolerance, scalability, QoS, security
4. **Topologies**: When to use hub-and-spoke vs mesh vs other topologies
5. **Internet Connections**: DSL, cable, cellular, satellite differences
6. **Security Threats**: External vs internal threats and appropriate countermeasures
7. **Cloud Services**: SaaS, PaaS, IaaS definitions and examples
8. **Network Trends**: BYOD, collaboration, video communications, IoT

### Memory Tricks:
- **End Devices = Endpoints** (where communication starts/ends)
- **Intermediary = In the middle** (connects and forwards)
- **LAN = Local** (building/campus)
- **WAN = Wide** (cities/countries)
- **Fault Tolerance = Fault Tolerant** (keeps working when things break)
- **Scalability = Scale up** (grows easily)
- **QoS = Quality of Service** (prioritizes important traffic)

### Common Exam Scenarios:
- **Small office network design** → Cost-effective solutions
- **Device identification** → End device vs intermediary device
- **Security for different network sizes** → Appropriate security measures
- **Network characteristic requirements** → Match characteristic to business need
- **Internet connection selection** → Based on requirements and location
