## Answer Key

**Question 1: C) 802.3ab**  
*Explanation: IEEE 802.3ab defines 1000BASE-T (Gigabit Ethernet over copper twisted pair). 802.3i is for 10BASE-T, 802.3u is for 100BASE-T, and 802.3an is for 10GBASE-T.*

**Question 2: B) Crossover cable**  
*Explanation: When connecting similar devices (switch to switch) without Auto MDI-X support, a crossover cable is required to swap the TX and RX pins (1↔3, 2↔6).*

**Question 3: C) 4 pairs (8 wires)**  
*Explanation: 1000BASE-T uses all 4 pairs (8 wires) bidirectionally, unlike 10/100BASE-T which only uses 2 pairs (4 wires).*

**Question 4: B) Baseband signaling**  
*Explanation: "BASE" in Ethernet standards refers to baseband signaling, where the entire bandwidth of the medium is used for a single communication channel.*

**Question 5: A) Pins 1 and 2**  
*Explanation: PCs transmit (TX) on pins 1-2 and receive (RX) on pins 3-6. Switches do the opposite: RX on pins 1-2, TX on pins 3-6.*

**Question 6: B) 100 meters**  
*Explanation: The maximum distance for UTP cables in Ethernet networks is 100 meters (328 feet) for all copper-based Ethernet standards.*

**Question 7: C) 10GBASE-ER**  
*Explanation: 10GBASE-ER supports up to 30 km transmission distance. 10GBASE-SR supports 400m, 10GBASE-LR supports 10km, and 1000BASE-LX supports up to 5km on single-mode fiber.*

**Question 8: C) Automatically detects and adjusts for cable type**  
*Explanation: Auto MDI-X automatically detects whether a straight-through or crossover cable is needed and adjusts the pin configuration accordingly, eliminating the need for crossover cables.*

**Question 9: C) SMF uses laser-based light and supports longer distances**  
*Explanation: Single-mode fiber uses laser-based light with a narrow core and supports very long distances. Multi-mode fiber uses LED-based light with a wider core for medium distances.*

**Question 10: B) 2 pairs (4 wires)**  
*Explanation: 10BASE-T and 100BASE-T only use 2 pairs (4 wires) for data transmission. Only 1000BASE-T and 10GBASE-T use all 4 pairs (8 wires).*

## Scoring Guide
- **9-10 correct**: Excellent! You have mastered interfaces and cables concepts.
- **7-8 correct**: Good job! Review the specific standards and pin configurations you missed.
- **5-6 correct**: Fair. Focus more on cable types, standards, and fiber vs copper differences.
- **Below 5**: Review the entire interfaces and cables section thoroughly.

## Key Study Points
- **Cable Types**: Straight-through (different devices), Crossover (same devices), Auto MDI-X eliminates crossover need
- **IEEE Standards**: 802.3i (10 Mbps), 802.3u (100 Mbps), 802.3ab (1 Gbps), 802.3an (10 Gbps)
- **Pin Configuration**: PC TX on 1-2, RX on 3-6; Switch opposite
- **Wire Pairs**: 10/100BASE-T uses 2 pairs, 1000BASE-T/10GBASE-T uses 4 pairs
- **Fiber Types**: SMF (laser, long distance, expensive), MMF (LED, medium distance, cheaper)
- **Maximum Distances**: UTP = 100m, Fiber ranges from 400m to 30km depending on standard
