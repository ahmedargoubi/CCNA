## Answer Key

1. **A)** JSON uses key-value pairs and supports data types such as strings, numbers, arrays, and objects.
2. **C)** `<tag>content</tag>` - XML elements must have opening and closing tags.
3. **B)** YAML uses indentation to represent hierarchy.
4. **C)** YAML - Most human-readable due to minimal syntax and indentation.
5. **B)** JSON is less verbose and easier to parse programmatically.
6. **C)** Invalid YAML list - missing dashes (-) for list items.
7. **B)** XML - Self-describing and tag-based structure.
8. **B)** Ansible - Uses YAML for playbooks and JSON for data exchange.
9. **B)** `{ "name": "Router1", "ip": "192.168.1.1" }` - All keys must be in quotes.
10. **C)** Indentation must use spaces (tabs are not recommended).
11. **A)** null - JSON uses lowercase 'null' to represent absence of value.
12. **A)** Attributes - XML attributes provide additional element information.
13. **A)** `# This is a comment` - YAML uses hash symbol for comments.
14. **B)** NETCONF - Network management protocol that uses XML encoding.
15. **C)** .yaml or .yml - Both extensions are commonly used for YAML files.
16. **C)** Array - Array is a structured data type, not primitive.
17. **B)** Square brackets `[]` - JSON arrays use square bracket notation.
18. **C)** Use of indentation and minimal syntax - Makes YAML highly readable.
19. **B)** Use spaces only - YAML standard recommends spaces over tabs.
20. **A)** JSON Schema (for JSON) and XSD (for XML) - Both formats support schema validation.

## Scoring Guide
- **18-20 correct:** Excellent! Ready for CCNA automation section
- **15-17 correct:** Good knowledge, review missed topics
- **12-14 correct:** Fair understanding, more practice needed
- **Below 12:** Study data formats fundamentals again

## Key CCNA Exam Tips
- **Protocol associations:** JSON with RESTCONF, XML with NETCONF, YAML with Ansible
- **Syntax rules:** JSON requires quotes on keys, YAML uses indentation, XML uses tags
- **Human readability:** YAML > JSON > XML
- **Parsing efficiency:** JSON > XML for REST APIs
- **Schema validation:** Both JSON and XML support schema validation
