## Answer Key & Explanations

### Question 1: **B** - 1
Static routes have an administrative distance of 1, making them highly trusted but not as trusted as directly connected routes (AD=0).

### Question 2: **C** - The interface Fa0/0 has not been activated
A directly connected network will only appear in the routing table when the interface is both configured with an IP address AND activated with the "no shutdown" command.

### Question 3: **C** - Static route with AD 1, metric 0
**Administrative Distance hierarchy**: Connected (0) > Static (1) > EIGRP (90) > OSPF (110) > RIP (120). Lower AD wins regardless of metric.

### Question 4: **B** - A network directly connected to the router interface  
The "C" code indicates a directly connected network. This route is automatically added when an interface is configured and active.

### Question 5: **B** - To route packets when no specific route exists for the destination
A default route (0.0.0.0/0) is the "route of last resort" used when no more specific route matches the destination.

### Question 6: **B** - 192.168.50.0/24 via 10.0.0.2
**Longest prefix match rule**: /24 is more specific than /16 or /0, so the 192.168.50.0/24 route is selected.

### Question 7: **B** - `ip route 192.168.1.0 255.255.255.0 10.0.0.1`
This is the correct Cisco IOS syntax for configuring a static route with destination network, subnet mask, and next-hop.

### Question 8: **B** - The administrative distance
In the format [AD/Metric], 110 is the administrative distance (OSPF default), and 65 is the metric.

### Question 9: **C** - Static routing
Static routing requires no routing protocol traffic, making it the most secure option with zero protocol overhead.

### Question 10: **A** - EIGRP route (AD=90, Metric=2816)
EIGRP has the lowest administrative distance (90) among the dynamic routing protocols listed, so it will be preferred.

### Question 11: **A** - Network: 172.16.10.48, Broadcast: 172.16.10.63
**/28 = 4 host bits, group size = 16**
- 50 รท 16 = 3 remainder 2
- Network: 3 ร 16 = 48
- Broadcast: 48 + 16 - 1 = 63

### Question 12: **B** - They have an administrative distance greater than dynamic routing protocols
A floating static route has an administrative distance greater than the administrative distance of another static route or dynamic route, making it a backup route.

### Question 13: **C** - Traffic will be load-balanced between both routes
When multiple routes have the same administrative distance and metric, Cisco routers perform equal-cost load balancing.

### Question 14: **C** - The route is a candidate default route
The asterisk (*) typically marks routes that are candidates for the default route or gateway of last resort.

### Question 15: **B** - `ip route 0.0.0.0 0.0.0.0 10.0.0.1 200`
A floating static route with high AD (200) ensures it's only used when dynamic routes (AD 90-120) are unavailable.
